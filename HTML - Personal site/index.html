    <h3>Some facts related to COVID in my area</h3>
    <p>The health officials are now disturbed over the fact that more women have started testing positive for the deadly virus - till now the majority of the patients were men.
        <br>
        <br>

      <em>"This suggests that men are acting as carriers and transferring the infection. The men had been exposing themselves to people who have already contracted the virus. We request people to stay indoors if they are worried about the well being of their near and dear ones. Every house and every person in the containment areas will be checked," the official said.<em></p>
